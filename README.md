Student Record Management System

**Overview**

The Student Record Management System is a C++ program designed to manage student records efficiently. It offers a simple and intuitive interface to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data. This program is particularly useful for educational institutions or anyone who needs to maintain and manage student records.


**Features**

Add a New Student Record: If there is no data for a student, you can add a new record with details such as the student's name, roll number, and other information.

Display All Student Details: View the details of all the students currently stored in the system at once.

Search for a Student by Roll Number: Quickly retrieve a student's details by searching using their unique roll number.

Update a Student's Details: Update or modify the details of an existing student by providing their roll number.

Delete a Student Record by Name: Remove a student's record from the system by entering their name.


**Program Structure**

The system uses C++ classes and file handling to ensure persistence and efficient management of data. Below are the key components of the program:

1] Student Class:

Contains attributes like name, roll number, age, and other relevant details.
Includes member functions for adding, displaying, updating, and deleting records.

2] Menu-Driven Interface:

A simple text-based interface is provided for users to interact with the system and select operations.


**How to execute the program**

1] Compile the Program: Use a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile the program:

>> g++ student_record_management.cpp -o student_record_management

2] Run the Program: Execute the compiled file:
>> ./student_record_management

3] Interact with the System: 

Follow the menu prompts to:

a] Add a new student record.
